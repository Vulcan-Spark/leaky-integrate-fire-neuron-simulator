# Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Simulator ðŸ§ 

This is a basic Python simulation of a spiking neuron using the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, a fundamental concept in computational neuroscience.

## Features
- Simulates membrane potential over time
- Simple threshold-based spike mechanism
- Visualizes neuron activity in response to constant input

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `lif_neuron.py` using Python 3
3. View the plot to understand neuron dynamics

## Dependencies
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
